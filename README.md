Multi-Camera Person Tracking System - 
A robust, real-time person tracking system that can monitor and track individuals across multiple camera feeds simultaneously. The system uses deep learning for person detection and tracking, with support for interactive person selection and persistent tracking across camera views. We offer an AI system that can track individuals across multiple surveillance cameras using facial recognition, clothing attributes, and movement patterns. The model accurately track individuals in recorded feeds, maintain accuracy across different angles and lighting conditions, also a person is tracked at the last known camera locations.

Features :
  •	Real-time person detection and tracking across multiple camera feeds
  •	Interactive person selection via click interface
  •	Robust tracking with appearance and motion features
  •	Temporal smoothing and motion prediction
  •	Performance optimization with batch processing and GPU acceleration  
  •	Persistent tracking data storage with SQLite
  •	Advanced visualization with motion trails and prediction
  •	Memory-efficient frame processing with pooling
  •	Comprehensive error handling and logging
  •	Resource usage monitoring

Requirements :
  •	Python 3.8+
  •	PyTorch
  •	OpenCV (cv2)
  •	NumPy
  •	SQLite3
  •	Psutil
  •	Threading
  •	logging

Required Python packages :
~pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy psutil

System Architecture :
The system consists of several key components:
  1.	VideoStream: Optimized video capture with frame buffering and error recovery
  2.	FeatureExtractor: Deep learning-based person detection and feature extraction
  3.	TrackedPerson: Person state management with motion prediction
  4.	DatabaseManager: Persistent storage of tracking data with thread-safe operations
  5.	MultiCameraTracker: Core tracking logic with multi-camera coordination

Usage :
  1.	Initialize the system:

      from tracking_system import MultiCameraTracker

      # Initialize tracker
      tracker = MultiCameraTracker()

      # Register cameras
      sources = {
          1: "path/to/video1.mp4",
          2: "path/to/video2.mp4"
      # Add more cameras as needed
      }

      for camera_id, source in sources.items():
          tracker.register_camera(camera_id)

  2.	Process frames:

      # In your main loop
      for camera_id, frame in camera_feeds:
          processed_frame = tracker.process_frame(frame, camera_id)
          # Display or store processed frame
          
  3.	Select person to track:

      # Enable selection mode
      tracker.toggle_selecting_mode()
      
      # Selection is done via mouse click in the UI
      # The system will automatically track the selected person
